      <h3>Near Campus</h3>
      <p>No Car? No problem! There is a lot you can do in St. Louis that is walking distance from campus. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/parks/parks/browse-parks/view-park.cfm?parkID=1&amp;parkName">Forest Park</a>- Just a 10 minute walk from campus gives you the most amazing park with tons of room for running or just relaxing. Sit on Art Hill with a book on a nice day to enjoy the weather!</li>
        <li>The Loop- Take the overpass on campus straight to the Loop for excellent restaurants and shopping!</li>
        <li>Clayton- the best area for restaurants near campus! See <a href="eating.html">Where to Eat</a> for Clayton restaurant recommendations.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Metro</h3>
      <p>Every semester each student can get a UPass, which gives you free transportation on the Metro. Use the metro to go straight downtown to take in a baseball game, visit the arch, or the famous adult playground called The City Museum. Visit <a href="http://www.downtownstl.org/">Downtown STL</a> for events and other fun activities!</p>
      
      <h3>A Bit Farther..</h3>
      <p>If you have a car at WashU, you can explore St. Louis a bit farther. There are many neighborhoods with fun restaurants, shopping, and other activities, such as Soulard, the Central West End, Clayton, and Towers Grove.</p>
